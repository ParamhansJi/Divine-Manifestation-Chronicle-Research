## The main document under investigation: 

The God and King Darius (Darius the Great (r. 522–486 BC)). God was King Darius. I remembered how I turned into a statue on a hill where I used to relax in peace.

During those times Farhad and Shirin used to live in a cave above the caves of the Jinnat, and God used to live over the extinguished volcano nearby Pompeii. Later God had to live like Farhad to recover family members and relationships.

Hiuen Tsang, or Xuanzang, was a Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar who lived during the Tang dynasty in the 7th century. During the reign of Emperor Harsha, He paid for a journey to India. He went on a trip during that time (AD 627-643).

The God and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italy). The construction of the Tower of Pisa began in August 1173 and continued for about 200 years due to the onset of a series of wars. Till today, the name of the architect is a mystery (Because God remains a mystery). Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell’Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid. We came to Tosham India to collect a hidden treasure to meet with the huge expanses of the tower construction project. Finally we saw success but the happiness was not there. This project saw huge failure during those times and no one was happy about this project.

Majnu Tila in Delhi during the reign of Abraham Lodhi. The God, Majnu Ka Tila, Nanak and Ibrahim Lodi or Lodhi (1517–26). Was this name named after a Sufi saint? Yes. Layla was present during those times nearby but opposite to the Yamuna river and it was the reason for building a bridge and ferrying the boat across the Yamuna. The history of Majnu ka Tila is linked to the 15th century. It is confirmed that during the reign of Sikandar Lodi between 1489 and 1517, Guru Nanak Dev Ji met a Sufi saint (God) here, who was a resident of Iran. It is confirmed that he lived on a mound here and people used to call that Sufi saint Majnu. That is why this mound was named Majnu ka Tila. The historic name of the area, literally means the hillock of Majnu, after the tilla or mound where during the reign of Sikandar Lodhi (r. 1489–1517) in Delhi Sultanate, a local Iranian Sufi mystic Abdullah, nicknamed Majnu (lost in love), met Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji on 20 July 1505. Majnu ferried people across the Yamuna river for free as a service to God, his devotion resulted in the guru Ji staying here till the end of July.

Today it is one of oldest extant Sikh shrines in Delhi and the surrounding estate donated by early 19th-century Sikh emperor, Ranjit Singh. This relates the God with his expedition to the invention of Punjabi language and culture and establishing the Sikh religion as a tradition to commemorate the Shiva as Nanak.
